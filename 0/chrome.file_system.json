{"dependencies":[{"kind":"library","name":"package:js/js.dart","id":"js","comment":"\nThe js.dart library provides simple JavaScript invocation from Dart that\nworks on both Dartium and on other modern browsers via Dart2JS.\n\nIt provides a model based on scoped [Proxy] objects.  Proxies give Dart\ncode access to JavaScript objects, fields, and functions as well as the\nability to pass Dart objects and functions to JavaScript functions.  Scopes\nenable developers to use proxies without memory leaks - a common challenge\nwith cross-runtime interoperation.\n\nThe top-level [context] getter provides a [Proxy] to the global JavaScript\ncontext for the page your Dart code is running on.  In the following example:\n\n    import 'package:js/js.dart' as js;\n\n    void main() {\n      js.context.alert('Hello from Dart via JavaScript');\n    }\n\njs.context.alert creates a proxy to the top-level alert function in\nJavaScript.  It is invoked from Dart as a regular function that forwards to\nthe underlying JavaScript one.  By default, proxies are released when\nthe currently executing event completes, e.g., when main is completes\nin this example.\n\nThe library also enables JavaScript proxies to Dart objects and functions.\nFor example, the following Dart code:\n\n    js.context.dartCallback = new Callback.once((x) => print(x*2));\n\ndefines a top-level JavaScript function 'dartCallback' that is a proxy to\nthe corresponding Dart function.  The [Callback.once] constructor allows the\nproxy to the Dart function to be retained across multiple events;\ninstead it is released after the first invocation.  (This is a common\npattern for asychronous callbacks.)\n\nNote, parameters and return values are intuitively passed by value for\nprimitives and by reference for non-primitives.  In the latter case, the\nreferences are automatically wrapped and unwrapped as proxies by the library.\n\nThis library also allows construction of JavaScripts objects given a [Proxy]\nto a corresponding JavaScript constructor.  For example, if the following\nJavaScript is loaded on the page:\n\n    function Foo(x) {\n      this.x = x;\n    }\n\n    Foo.prototype.add = function(other) {\n      return new Foo(this.x + other.x);\n    }\n\nthen, the following Dart:\n\n    var foo = new js.Proxy(js.context.Foo, 42);\n    var foo2 = foo.add(foo);\n    print(foo2.x);\n\nwill construct a JavaScript Foo object with the parameter 42, invoke its\nadd method, and return a [Proxy] to a new Foo object whose x field is 84.\n\nSee [samples](http://dart-lang.github.com/js-interop/example) for more\nexamples of usage.\n\nSee this [article](http://www.dartlang.org/articles/js-dart-interop) for\nmore detailed discussion.\n","children":[{"superclass":{"name":"Object","refId":"dart.core/Object"},"isAbstract":true,"kind":"class","name":"Serializable","id":"Serializable","comment":"Marker class used to indicate it is serializable to js.

See\n<http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10>\nfor the specification of JavaScript regular expressions.\n\n## Collections\n\nThe dart:core library provides basic collections,\nsuch as [List], [Map], and [Set].\n\nA List is an ordered collection of objects, with a length.\nLists are sometimes called arrays.\nUse a List when you need to access objects by index.\n\n    List superheroes = [ 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Harry Potter' ];\n\nA Set is an unordered collection of unique objects.\nYou cannot get an item by index (position).\nAdding a duplicate item has no effect.\n\n    Set villians = new Set();\n    villians.add('Joker');\n    villians.addAll( ['Lex Luther', 'Voldemort'] );\n\nA Map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.\nMaps are sometimes called associative arrays because\nmaps associate a key to some value for easy retrieval.\nKeys are unique.\nUse a Map when you need to access objects\nby a unique identifier.\n\n    Map sidekicks = { 'Batman': 'Robin',\n                      'Superman': 'Lois Lane',\n                      'Harry Potter': 'Ron and Hermione' };\n\nIn addition to these classes,\ndart:core contains [Iterable],\nan interface that defines functionality\ncommon in collections of objects.\nExamples include the ability\nto run a function on each element in the collection,\nto apply a test to each element, \nto retrieve an object, and to determine length.\n\nIterable is implemented by List and Set,\nand used by Map for its keys and values.\n\nFor other kinds of collections, check out the\n[dart:collection](#dart-collection) library.\n\n## Date and time\n\nUse [DateTime] to represent a point in time\nand [Duration] to represent a span of time.\n\nYou can create DateTime objects with constructors\nor by parsing a correctly formatted string.\n\n    DateTime now = new DateTime.now();\n    DateTime berlinWallFell = new DateTime(1989, 11, 9);\n    DateTime moonLanding = DateTime.parse(\"1969-07-20\");\n\nCreate a Duration object specifying the individual time units.\n\n    Duration timeRemaining = new Duration(hours:56, minutes:14);\n\nIn addition to DateTime and Duration,\ndart:core contains the [Stopwatch] class for measuring elapsed time.\n    \n## Uri\n\nA [Uri] object represents a uniform resource identifier,\nwhich identifies a resource on the web.\n\n    Uri dartlang = Uri.parse('http://dartlang.org/');\n    \n## Errors\n\nThe [Error] class represents the occurrence of an error\nduring runtime.\nSubclasses of this class represent specific kinds of errors.\n\n## Other documentation\n\nFor more information about how to use the built-in types, refer to\n[Built-in Types](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html#built-in-types)\nin Chapter 2 of\n[Dart: Up and Running](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/).\n\nAlso, see\n[dart:core - Numbers, Collections, Strings, and More](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-dartcore---strings-collections-and-more)\nfor more coverage of classes in this package.\n\nThe \n[Dart Language Specification](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec/)\nprovides technical details.\n","children":[{"kind":"class","name":"Object","id":"Object","comment":"\nEverything in Dart is an [Object].\n","children":[{"returnType":{"name":"bool","refId":"dart.core/bool"},"isOperator":true,"kind":"method","name":"==","id":"==1()","comment":"\nThe equality operator.\n\nThe default behavior for all [Object]s is to return true if and\nonly if [:this:] and [other] are the same object.\n\nOverride this method to specify a different equality relation on\na class.
